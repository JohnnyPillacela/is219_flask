[![Production Workflow](https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_flask/actions/workflows/prod.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_flask/actions/workflows/prod.yml)

* [Production Deployment](https://kwilliam-prod.herokuapp.com/)

[![Development Workflow](https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_flask/actions/workflows/dev.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaw393939/docker_flask/actions/workflows/dev.yml)

* [Developmental Deployment](https://kwilliam-dev.herokuapp.com/)

## Setting up CI/CD

The result of this will be that when you create a pull request to merge a branch to master, it will deploy to your
heroku development app/dyno and when you merge or push to master on github, it will deploy the app to the production heroku
app/dyno...
### Instructions

1. Clone this repo to your local (DO NOT FORK THIS REPO, IF YOU DO YOU HAVE TO ENABLE ACTIONS BEFORE ANYTHING RUNS)
2. Create a new repo on your own account
3. Remove the origin remote and replace it with your own new repo.  (Do not add a readme or anything it should be empty)
4. Create an account with Heroku, create an app for production and an app for development
5. Create a new repo in Docker hub

#### Setup Docker and Heroku Credentials In the Repository Settings under Action -> Secret

6. Add repository settings for action secrets for DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, HEROKU_API_KEY (put the appropriate
   values in)
### GitHub Notes:  Set the action secrets repository in: -> settings -> actions -> secrets
### Heroku Notes: Get the heroku API key from account in: -> applications -> create authorization button

#### Change GitHub Actions Workflows for Dev and Prod

6. Change line 42 to have your docker repo address in: .github/workflows/prod.yml
7. change lines 58 to have your heroku app name in: .github/workflows/prod.yml
8. change line 59 to have your heroku email in: .github/workflows/prod.yml
9. change line 31 to have your heroku app name in .github/workflows/dev.yml
10. change line 32 to have your heroku email in .github/workflows/dev.yml
11. Push your local repo and fix any errors that appear when the workflow is running. You can check the workflow in the
    actions.

## Running Locally

1. To Build with docker compose:
   docker compose up --build
2. To run tests, Lint, and Coverage report use this command: pytest --pylint --cov

.pylintrc is the config for pylint .coveragerc is the config for coverage setup.py is a config file for pytest
